# Django Flash Status

A tiny and simple add-on to django-flash to add and display multiple status and error messages for a user. Feedback welcome!


## Usage

You can add a status message like so:

request.add_status('Your settings were successfully updated!')

You can add an error message like so:

request.add_error('All form fields are required. Please see errors below.')

In fact you can add any type of a message to a list of messages like so:

request.add_message('zings', 'Your mom.')
request.add_message('zings', 'That\'s what she said.')


## Setup

First you'll need to have django-flash installed. You can find it on GitHub at:
http://github.com/danielfm/django-flash/

To use django-flash-status you'll need both FlashMiddleware and FlashStatusMiddleware included in your middleware settings.

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    ...
    'djangoflash.middleware.FlashMiddleware',
    'djangoflashstatus.middleware.FlashStatusMiddleware',
    ...
)

That's all!

To use the flash.html template you'll need to include the django-flash context processors in your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS setting.

TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
    ...
    'djangoflash.context_processors.flash',
    ...
)

You'll also need to add djangoflashstatus to your INSTALLED_APPS so your project can find the template. Alternately, you can the location of this template to your TEMPLATE_DIRS setting.

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'djangoflashstatus', # flash.html template
    ...
)
